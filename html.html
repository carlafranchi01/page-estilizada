                <p>King is a canine-like creature that somewhat resembles a fox. He has mostly dark grey fur, although his belly and the tip of his tail are covered in purplish-grey fur. The highlight of his appearance is a dog-like skull with white horns on his head, one of which is broken. As of the episode "Echoes of the Past", however, his broken horn has been glued back on by Luz.</p>

                <p>King is loud, feisty, self-centered, expressive, lazy, comedic and constantly laughs at anything that gives him enjoyment. Befitting his name, he is used to acting like a monarch, treating people and objects as minions, ordering others around, and acting bigger than he is. He sometimes manages to assume leadership of some form, but loses it due to his negligence and ignorance. King hates being called cute and being treated like a baby, yet due to his small size, has to rely on accessories made for infants.</p>
